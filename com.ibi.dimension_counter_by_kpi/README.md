# Dimension counter by KPI

For installation instructions please visit this [link] (https://github.com/ibi/wf-extensions-chart/wiki/Installing-a-WebFocus-Extension "Installing a WebFocus Extension").

## Description

This extension is a small dimension counter, that shows the number of entries in one dimension and based on a KPI, the top dimension entry.
It is completely flexible, so you can overwrite line one and three with a custom text, show/hide line three and the top dimension entry, add a special text field for the dimension and change a lot of styling settings.
